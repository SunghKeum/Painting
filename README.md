<h1>Painting (SQL Project)</h1>

<h2>üìù Project Description</h2>
In this SQL project, I use Python packages (psycopg2, pandas, and sqlalchemy) under Jupyter Notebook environment to upload data from CSV files to PostgreSQL database tables. After import, I use SQL queries to answer several questions related to the famous paintings dataset. You can view the data used for this project [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings).
